# Data Analysis Code Summary
These projects are from a course on free code camp. 

## 1. Statistics of Given List
- Computes statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, sum) of a 3x3 matrix.
- Uses NumPy for efficient computation.

## 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
- Analyzes demographic data from a CSV file using Pandas.
- Answers questions about race distribution, average age of men, percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree, and more.

## 3. Medical Data Visualizer
- Visualizes medical examination data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Adds BMI-based "overweight" column, normalizes cholesterol and glucose data, and visualizes data with bar plots and heatmaps.

## 4. Page View Time Series Visualizer
- Visualizes time series data of daily page views using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Draws line charts, bar charts, and box plots to analyze trends and seasonality in page views.

## 5. Sea Level Predictor
- Analyzes global average sea level change data and predicts sea level change through 2050.
- Uses linear regression to fit a line of best fit to the data and predicts sea level rise in 2050.
